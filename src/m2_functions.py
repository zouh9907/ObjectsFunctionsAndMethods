# DONE: 1. PUT YOUR NAME IN THE ABOVE LINE and...
#
#   Allow this file to use the rosegraphics.py file by marking the src
#   directory as a "Sources Root".  Do that by right clicking on the src folder,
#   then selector  Mark Directory As --> Sources Root
#
#   Expand the import lines below and watch the red underlines disappear as you do that step.
#   You will do that once for every project that uses rosegraphics so get used to it. :)
#
#   Then run this module and look for more TO DO's later in the file.

#     -- For each function definition:
#          -- Where does that function definition begin?

#     -- How many times does   main   call the   turtle1   function?

#     -- How many times does   main   call the   turtle2   function?

########################################################################
#
# DONE: 3.
#   Define another function,
#   immediately below the end of the definition of   turtle3   above.
#   Name your new function   turtle4.
#
#   The Python "pep8" coding standard says to leave exactly 2 blank
#   lines between function definitions, so be sure to do so.
#
#   Your new function should:
#    1. Define a SimpleTurtle (as   turtle3   as other functions did).
#    2. Set your SimpleTurtle's
#               pen
#       to a new rg.Pen with a color and thickness of your own choosing.
#       See the COLORS.txt  file in this project for a list of legal color-names.
#    3. Make your SimpleTurtle move around a bit.
#
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
#           ** IMPORTANT:                 **
#           ** Nothing fancy is required. **
#           ** Save fancy stuff for exercises later today. **
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
#
#   BTW, if you see a RED underline, that means that there is
#     a SYNTAX (notation) error at that line or elsewhere.
#   Get help as needed to fix any such errors.
#
########################################################################

########################################################################
#
# DONE: 4.
#   Add a line to   main   that CALLS your new function immediately
#   AFTER  main  calls turtle1.  So:
#     -- the SimpleTurtle from turtle1 should move,
#     -- then YOUR SimpleTurtle should move,
#     -- then the other 3 SimpleTurtles should move.
#
#   Run this module.  Check that there is another SimpleTurtle (yours)
#   that uses the pen you chose and moves around a bit.
#   If your code has errors (shows RED in the Console window)
#   or does not do what it should, get help as needed to fix it.
#
########################################################################

########################################################################
#
# DONE: 5.
#   The previous two TODOs IMPLEMENTED a function (TO DO 3)
#   and TESTED that function (TO DO 4).
#
#   Now implement AND test one more function, defining it immediately
#   below the definition of your   turtle4   function.
#   Name your new function   turtle5.
#
#   The Python "pep8" coding standard says to leave exactly 2 blank
#   lines between function definitions, so be sure to do so.
#
#   Your new function should define TWO new SimpleTurtles,
#   set their characteristics (i.e., instance variables) as you choose,
#   and make each move a bit.
#
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
#           ** IMPORTANT:                 **
#           ** Nothing fancy is required. **
#           ** Save fancy stuff for exercises later today. **
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
#
#  Get help as needed on this (and every!) exercise!
#
#  As always COMMIT and Push your work as often as you want, but for sure after
#  you have tested it and believe that it is correct.
#
#   Reminder of those steps...
#   COMMIT your work by selecting VCS from the menu bar, then select Commit Changes
#   Make sure only the files you want to commit are checked and optionally
#   add a quick Commit message to describe your work.  Then hover over the
#   Commit button and select Commit and Push.  Commit saves the work to
#   your computer.  "and Push" saves a copy of your work up into your Github
#   repository (saving to the cloud is a better way to permanently safe work).
